To Train the model Run authorProfile.py
this file will take input from input/blogtext.csv, which is dowloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/blog-authorship-corpus

After getting model, generated from authroprofile.py,( the name of the model file is author_model.sav), use this model to predict the profile
I have used streamlit to provide input from the web application and this input will used to predict the profile.
